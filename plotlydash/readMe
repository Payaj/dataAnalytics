Note:
The first graph(line chart) uses the heighborhood drop down menu to filter and query the transactions from the database.
The bed, type, year, sqft, $/sqft are used to filter the dataframe in pandas way(not query).

If you need to update the line chart, you need to make changes to the drop down menu/click box/slider, then click the "update" button.
This update process may take long time! Do not change anything until the webpage is fully updated(as shown on the browser tab). 
If the tab shows "updating", DO NOT TOUCH ANYTHING otherwise the web server will crush!!!!

The second gragh(bar chart) with k mean cluster uses the year slider to filter and query all neighborhood transactions from the database.
The bed, type, sqft, $/sqft are used to filter the dataframe in pandas way(not query).
Again, if the tab shows "updating", DO NOT TOUCH ANYTHING otherwise the web server will crush!!!
